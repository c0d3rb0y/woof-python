# woof-python
Making python simpler to kids. Hopefully.

# How to use
Create a new file with the .txt or .howl file extentsion, and put the readfile.py file in the same directory. Edit readfile.py to have your .howl instead of testfile.howl.

# All commands
say message - replace message with what you want it to say (basically reinventing the print command)

close - exit program

add 1 1 - addition, just replace the 1s with your stuff

sub 1 1 - subtraction, just replace the 1s with your numbers

mult 1 1 - multiplication, just replace the 1s with your stuff

div 1 1 - division, just replace the 1s with your numbers

save:
 
 save new (variable name) - Creates a new variable with the name specified.
 
 save set (variable name) (data) - Sets the chosen variable's value to the data you input
 

Any python works, as long as it's on one line. Check testfile.howl for a little more understanding.
# Command-line only commands
help - help screen

amogus - red is sus vote him out
