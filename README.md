Making python simpler to kids. Hopefully.

# How-to
First, make sure you have some kind of text editor and an installation of python. After doing so, create a new file with the .howl file extentsion. Put readfile.py in the same directory. Code your .howl (not detailing how here, go to the wiki page to find instructions for a your first program). Edit with your readfile.py to have your .howl instead of testfile.howl. Finally, run readfile.py. It will output in text.

# All commands
wait 1 - replace the 1 with your time to wait

say message - replace message with what you want it to say

close - exit program

add 1 1 - addition, just replace the 1s with your stuff

sub 1 1 - subtraction, just replace the 1s with your numbers

mult 1 1 - multiplication, just replace the 1s with your stuff

div 1 1 - division, just replace the 1s with your numbers

Any python works, as long as it's on one line. Check testfile.howl for a little more understanding.
