# woof-python
Making python simpler to kids. Hopefully.

# Woof Editor
Automated .howl creation and quick project set up coming soonâ„¢

# How to use
Create a new file with the .txt or .howl file extentsion, and put the readfile.py file in the same directory. Edit readfile.py to have your .howl instead of testfile.howl.

# All commands
say message - replace message with what you want it to say (basically reinventing the print command)

close - exit program

add 1 1 - addition, just replace the 1s with your stuff

sub 1 1 - subtraction, just replace the 1s with your numbers

mult 1 1 - multiplication, just replace the 1s with your stuff

div 1 1 - division, just replace the 1s with your numbers

Any python works, as long as it's on one line. Check testfile.howl for a little more understanding.
# Command-line only commands
help - help screen
amogus - red is sus vote him out
# Known errors
commandline.py and readspecifiedfile.py only work in IDLE 3.8.4 for some reason. Luckily these are only meant to be used for development purpouses and the one that actually works is the one for publishing games.
